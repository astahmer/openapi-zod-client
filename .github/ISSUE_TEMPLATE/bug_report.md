- Is your issue related to zod or zodios ? This might be out-of-scope for us.
- Are you using a Swagger v2 input schema ? This is not supported and should migrate to OpenAPI V3+. You can do so by using the official Swagger Editor: https://editor.swagger.io/ using the Edit -> Convert to OpenAPI 3.0 menu
- Do you really need runtime validation ? If not, you might be interested in [typed-openapi](https://github.com/astahmer/typed-openapi)
